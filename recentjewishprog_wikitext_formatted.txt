* “Pinsk, and Moscow.                At the notable Conference at Kattowitz, in 1884, they were consolidated into the Montefiore Federa- tion,   and in 1887 into the Chovevei Zion; finally, in 1890, after nine years of feverish activity, the movement was legiti- mized by the Eussian Government, under the name The Com- mittee for the Promotion of Agriculture and Handicrafts among the Jews               of   Syria and Palestine, with    its   seat   in Odessa, whence          it   has been called briefly the Odessa        Com- mittee. The third event was the organization of the Zionist move- ment at the International Congress of Jews called by Theodor Herzl, in Basle, in 1897.   The platform of the movement, providing for the creation of “ a publicly-recognized and legalfy-assured        home for the Jewish people in Palestine,” is the precisest formulation and the most inclusive of the “ love 99 of Zion        idea.    Five years later the Eussian Chovevei Zion societies, or the      Odessa Committee, as they were then called, Zionism aims at making the devel- accepted it unreservedly. opment of the Holy Land the concern of the whole of the Diaspora.       And as in the Dispersion it desires to enlist the united forces of an organized world Jewry, so in Palestine its sphere    is   Jewish    life      in the whole.   Its   impetus does not flow through educational    and agricultural channels alone. It consciously seeks to affect and shape trade in Palestine, industry, finance, scientific investigations, general cultural enterprises, in a word, the complete social organization of the Jewish population in the Holy Land to the point at which it   becomes economically independent of the J ews ” outside of the land,“ of their alms, and gifts, and tribute, and of their planning and action in its behalf.”

In 1800 the descendants of the exiles, together with the so-called “ Arab 93 Jews, the descendants of Jews that never left the East, are said to have numbered 3000 in the land.     Not until the middle of the eighteenth century were they joined by considerable permanent groups of the Ashkenazic division. The newer settlers hailed chiefly from Poland and Southern Russia. They belonged largely to the sect of the Hasidim, and they gravitated for a century towards the Galilean centers, Safed and Tiberias, made famous by Cabalists and         saints. Since about the middle of the last century the immigrants from Eastern and Central Europe have been spreading over the whole country, first to the towns and from 1882 on to the rural districts.  This brings us up to the date of the New Settlement.    During the last generation immigrants in in- creasing numbers have been coming from Eussia, Bulgaria, Austria (Galicia, Bukowina, Transylvania), Hungary, Bou- mania, Germany, Holland, and the United States. They have swelled the Ashkenazic section until it is said to have reached now 85,000 out of the 100,000 Jews estimated to live in Pales- tine. But not by any means may the New Settlement claim all the late-comers. Some of them must be counted as belonging to the   Old Settlement. The Sefardic community has not been left unaugmented. The additions from Oriental countries during the last three- quarters of a century are, indeed, not Sefardim in the strict sense of the term, but as they approximate the         Spanish- Portuguese in liturgy and ritual, the convenient classification may be applied not only to the North African Maghrebim, from Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, but also to the”

If we accept the former estimate, and the estimate of 85,000 Ashkenazic Jews, we are forced to the supposition that only 1800 Sefardim live outside of Jerusalem, in Jaffa, Hebron, Tiberias, and Safed. The Sefardic section has occupied a distinctive place in the economy of Jewish life in Palestine, by reason of the Ottoman citizenship of its members.    Many of the sons of the early Eussian and Eoumanian colonists have also become Otto- mans, but among the immigrant Jews in the first generation there have been comparatively few willing to exchange the protection of the consuls of their European Governments for the jurisdiction of the Sublime Porte.      What will be the attitude towards* Turkish naturalization now that the system of Capitulations has been abrogated and the European consuls have no larger rights than in other countries, cannot even be conjectured during the disorder of war times.   That a number of J ews refused the liberal terms of the Ottoman Government when Turkey became a belligerent, and preferred to remain Russian, French, and English subjects, though their choice involved the hardship of leaving the country, proves nothing regarding the attitude of those who expect to make Palestine their permanent home.

But the vanguard in Palestine apparently did not wait for the encouraging action of the Conference.      At the very moment perhaps when it was taken in Europe, a new colony was born in Palestine, the Bilu settle- ment Katra (Gederah),     for which the Federation bought 70,000 vines.In the year following the Kattowitz Conference, $24,000 was expended on Palestine colonization, and $60,000 by the end of 1889. During that period and thereafter, the Odessa Committee, as, it will be remembered, the Federation was called after 1890, stayed and supported Petah Tikwah, Katra, and Wady el-Hanin in Judea; Hederah in Samaria, into which alone it sank another $18,600 in eight experimen- tal years;   and Yesod ha-Maalah and Mishmar ha-Yarden in Galilee.

* “Almost everywhere the mistake the colonists‘ initial poverty. was made of adopting a single crop. That caused absolute destitution in the years unfavorable to that crop whatever it might be.      Besides, it meant lack of employment for man and beast during a considerable part of the year, and therefore was not economical.      And when the only crop was vines, as in practically all the colonies under the Eothschild administra- tion, a bountiful vintage    was almost as disastrous as blight and dearth. Eishon le-Zion was the most notable victim of the question- able policy.    Ten men, augmented soon to seventeen, bought 758 acres of land.     The cost of installation was excessive, because water had to be brought from a distance, and the soil   was not adapted to grain, with which the        colonists started   out.  Baron de Rothschild, it will be         recalled, saved the colony.    He increased its landed possessions to 1894 acres, and a large part was planted with a million native vines, which, when it appeared that the Arab wines had small value in the market, were grafted with     French varieties, sauterne, malaga, and muscatel.     Wine-cellars were built, with the most modern appliances and with a capacity of 50,000 hectoliters (1,320,000 gallons).     Except that the wine-cellars were of more moderate proportions, the same course was adopted at Zichron Jacob and Rosh Pinnah, and, encouraged by the assur- ance that the ” administration 99 would buy whatever was pro- duced, Wady el-Hanin, Rehobot, Katra, and Hederah, though not under the Rothschild regime, followed their example.    The production turned out enormous, as much as a million and a half gallons a year.     In the meantime no measures had been taken to assure sales abroad.

* “prices paid for wines      would have to be reduced by half at least.  The effect on the colonists may be imagined. They had become accustomed to the pleasant security of the un- wavering price promised to them whatever the fluctuations of the market might be. In good years the seven wine-growing colonies had produced over a million and a half gallons, for which $172,500 had been paid by the Bothschild “ administra- tion.”   In future the income was to be variable and at best half as large.   The paramount task thus became the creation of a real instead of a fictitious market for their chief, in many instances their only, product, and until genuine sales could be negotiated, the most urgent measure was a reduction of the output. The problem was solved, naturally not without a good deal of painful bloodletting, by the ICA in co-operation with the wine-growers that had been sending their grapes to the cellars. The latter formed a syndicate of 352 members, giving pro- portional representation to Bishon le-Zion, Behobot, Zichron Jacob, Katra, Petah Tikwah, and Wady el-Hanin.          This corn- pan}‘’   took over the management of the wine-cellars, which it ]   eased for a nominal rent.   It was to pay in easy installments for the wine stored in the cellars      and reimburse Baron de Bothschild for the outstanding claims.     In addition it received as a gift a reserve fund of $320,000, from which current deficits were to be covered for five years.”

* “The importance of this farm school cannot be overestimated. For years the critics of Jewish Palestine colonization have justly pointed to the untrained Jewish woman on the farm as one of the radical difficulties. The Yemenite women, even before their houses are built for them, as soon as the place on which they are to be erected is designated, plot and plant their gardens for vegetables, for home use and for sale. That is the spirit of the true farmer’s wife, and Russian Jewish girls are acquiring it. As was mentioned before, there were some on the farm at Sedjera. They shouldered their hoes and went forth to the field, and worked all day without asking quarter. The same is said to be true of the girl farmers at Merhawiah, and the vegetable-growers at Med j del on the land of the Tiberias Plantation Company.       It is certain that one of the best farmers in Lower Galilee was a woman, to watch whom was a delight when she stood throwing feed to her barnyard full of geese, chickens, and pigeons; when she tended her well-cared-for cattle in their substantial stalls; when she dis- cussed prices with a would-be buyer, standing over her golden grain, as it lay heaped up in her store-chamber ; when she gave her orders to her employees at whose head she went to her fields ;   and when, in the gloaming, before the door of her own cottage, she discoursed on the value of bananas for Palestine, or told her reminiscences of the early days of the colonization —an embodiment of the Hebrew philosopher’s “ valiant woman. There are several other educational plans, partly under way, partly under discussion, which promise well for the future of agriculture.

The question has had many answers given               to   it.

Indeed, in the whole history of the new Jewish Palestine there has been but a single case of Jewish criminality When the interests of the colonies expand, the Waad ceases to act as a single undivided body on all concerns.     It appoints committees for the better exercise of some of its functions: a    committee on education, one on the administration of justice,  one on the constitution, one on the relation to the Wine-Growers Association, one on the co-operative purchase of fodder for the cattle of the colony, etc. The connection between the village and the Government is established, as in the Arab village, through a mukhtar, often a member of the Waad.    This is not peculiar to the villages. In Turkey a certain degree of autonomy is granted to ethno- graphic, national, and religious groups.       Hence the severance of nationalities and religious communities from each other in their peculiar “ quarters 99 is more marked than in the cities in most countries, and hence we have the internal govern- ment of the Jewish rural and city communities.

The situation offers redoubtable openings on both sides, and there have been a few bloody, even fatal encounters between the two nationalities. The general impression appears to be that the Shomerim are innocent of aggression; they have gone to extremes only in self-defense.   Besides insuring the safety of Jewish property, Ha-Shomer has raised the dignity of the Jew in the eyes of his Arab neighbors.

In 1881 Jerusalem is said to have had 35,000 inhabit- ants, of whom about 12,000 were Jews; in 191-1, 50,000 Jews out of 100,000 inhabitants were attributed to               it.   Jaffa   had 5000 Jews in 1905, by 1910 it had twice five thousand. Haifa had only 2000 out of 20,000 in 1910, but it has been growing at a rapid rate since then.         The significant point is that the increase in Jewish city populations corresponds to the develop- ment of the rural colonization work.

Above all it is conceded, even by some who are concerned officially, that the Halukkah, the source of most of the friction, stands in need of reform, and the existence of the Mizrahi party within the Zionist movement is a guarantee of future co-operation and amalgamation between the two sec- tions of the community. There have been signs of progress even in the matter of centralized organization.     As was mentioned before, the Jaffa community is a unit.       Sefardim and Ashkenazim act together. In Jerusalem, a few years ago, the collapse of one of the largest charitable institutions produced an acute crisis in com- munal affairs.        The Waad ha-Kelali saw an opportunity in favor of compacter organization.       It appointed   an executive committee, a Waad ha-Ir, a city council.       The move turned out to be premature, chiefly because the new body had no funds to apportion, as had been contemplated.     But even the failure is                an indication of the temper of the leaders. instructive as During the still acuter crisis produced by the present war, if the reports that have reached the outside world suffice as a basis for inferences, Jerusalem has learnt the need of a centralized life.   Bitter necessity may be welding the community into a unit.     To be sure, even though the immediate effect of hard- ships be as satisfactory as described, it would be rash to jump to the conclusion that the Kolel barriers are down for always.

According to Nawratzki, there are in Jaffa 8 such Talmud Torahs   ;   in Hebron, 4 ; in Haifa, 1   ;   in Tiberias, 2 ;   and in Safed, 4; with 1380 pupils and 71 teachers. The first protest against the system of instruction espoused by the Talmud Torah, which denied absolutely the need of even the most rudimentary secular education, was the Lamel School (1856), mentioned in the introduction to this article. The school was excommunicated by the Ashkenazic leaders, but it received a warm welcome from the Sefardim, to whom its”

When the Anglo- Jewish Association, in 1898, took over the Evelina de Rothschild School, the medium became English, and when the Hilf sverein came into the land at the beginning of the century, it gave a prominent place to   German.    It is all the more signifi- cant of the current of events that nevertheless each of these successive agencies allotted   more and more time to Hebrew than its predecessor.   The Evelina de Rothschild laid greater stress upon it than the Alliance, and the Hilfsverein more than co-ordinated it with German. Even the Alliance has had to modify its scheme, though, to be sure, it is the subven- tion of the Odessa Committee that maintains a number of its Hebrew teachers. Meantime the people were deciding the language question in their own way.   Circumstances forced the colonists to conduct their schools on the simplest basis.   The teachers came not from France, or England, or Germany, but from Russia.             It   was conceivable that a French or an English or a          German Jew should press his language upon Palestine as a culture-bearer. For the Russian Jew to do the same was unthinkable.                In Russia the study of Hebrew for living purposes had been inher- ited from the illuminati, the Maskilim, of the early nineteenth century.   The events of 1881-1882 and of 1891, and the rise of the Palestinian colonization projects, had only intensified love of the ancient holy language.      The country school teachers would instinctively have taught Jewish children in Palestine in Hebrew, even if the New Settlement had not put Hebrew upon its banner. From the first it had revolted against the confusion of tongues in Jewish Palestine. Hebrew naturally was the only compromise acceptable to all the Jewish “na-”
