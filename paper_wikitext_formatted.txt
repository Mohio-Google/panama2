* “18 ble to the plot. In the cutting edge of Zionism, in its most revolution­ ary expression, the essential dialogue is now between the Jew and the nations of the earth. What marks modem Zionism as a fresh beginning in Jewish history is that its ultimate values derive from the general milieu. The Messiah is now identified with the dream of an age of individual liberty, national freedom, and economic and social justice­ i.e., with the progressive faith of the nineteenth century. This is the true Copernican revolution which modem Zionism an­ nounced-and it patently represents a fundamental change not merely in the concept of the means to the Redemption but in end values. Every aspect of Jewish messianism has been completely transmuted by this new absolute. So, classical ·Judaism had, for the most part, imagined that at some propitious moment an inner turning by the Chosen People would be the preamble to evoking the saving grace of God. Zionism, too, knows that the Jewish people must be remade in order to be redeemed-indeed, its sweeping and passionate demands lent themselves to being spoken in language reminiscent of the proph­ ets ( thus providing one of the several bridges between the old and the new ) -but it is supremely aware that its millennium is out of reach without the assent and co-operation of the dominant political powers. In the movement’s heroic age, therefore, Theodor Herzl made the international scene his primary arena and spent his career, often in pathos and tragedy, in searching for a likely ally in the ante-cham­ bers of the potentates. Having embarked on the quest for a Jewish kingdom of this world, Zionism perforce had to address itself to the keeper of the keys to that kingdom, the gentile. Or, to state the point from a wider perspective, the scheme of Jewish religion had seen the messianic problem as one of resolving the tension between the Jew and his Maker-the Exile is punishment and atonement for sin; for the new doctrine, at its newest, the essential issue is the end of the millennia of struggle between the Jew and the world. The secularization of the messianic ideal called into question an· other of the basic concepts of Judaism, the notion of the “chosen peo­ ple.” Modem Zionism agreed with the classical faith that the Jews had once been chosen to lead the world, and, in this connection, it was not important whether it was believed that the choosing had been done by God or by the unique Jewish national genius. However, one question, that of the place of the Jew in the postmessianic era, cou ld not be avoided. Despite some occasional remarks to the contrary, th e weight of learned opinion in the authoritative religious writings an d the whole of popular Jewish feeling had always been certain that the”

It must also be remembered that the emancipation of west European Jewry involved communities which were few in number and most of which, even those which had to wait to the middle of the century to win their fight in its entirety, had once been freed by a stroke of the pen, by order of the advancing armies of France in the revolutionary era. Russian Jewry was massive, more than half of all the Jews of the world in the mid-nineteenth century, and no decree of full emancipation existed in its earlier history to give it the confidence of battling for a freedom that it had once already attained. What Russian Jewry as a whole, exclusive of its small modernist segment, was really hoping for in that era was not a doctrinaire political equality but an easing of the worst burdens of oppression. Even the pious proto-Zionism of Alkalai and Kalischer implied some amount of entry by the Jew into the mainstream of modernity. Both appealed to the rising nationalisms of Europe as the reason for a Jewish policy to be based on a comparable desire for national self­ determination. Kalischer ends a passage in which he attempts to show that the Redemption requires a beginning in man’s own efforts by pleading : “Let us take to heart the examples of the Italians, Poles, and Hungarians . . . All the other peoples have striven only for the sake of their own national honor; how much more should we exert ourselves, for our duty is to labor not only for the glory of our ancestors but for the glory of God who chose Zionl”18 Alkalai is particularly aware of the new political possibilities that the Emancipation had opened to the Jew. The prominence of individual Jews in European society and the later formation in 1 86o of the Alliance Israelite Uni­ verselle to conduct the political defense of Jewish rights all over the world were used by him as arguments for Zionism : the Jew has now learned to deal as an equal on the international scene; let him act, with all the political and economic power he has achieved in free­ dom, for the restoration of his people. In their own views of themselves, Kalischer was undoubtedly a pietist concerned with the widest extension of religious observance, with special emphasis on the neglected duty of dwelling in the Holy Land, and Alkalai was a cabbalist preparing the ground for the “end of days.” ( Alkalai kept imagining dates prophesied in the holy writ­ ings-his favorite was 1 840-which would mark the beginning of the lBSee text, Part 1 .”

It was not an end-value ( Thomas Jefferson contemplated a political revolution in every generation ) , for the ultimates were the in dividual ( the Rights of Man ) and the international society of men of reason ( the City of Man ) . By the middle of the nineteenth century the heyday of romanticism had intervened, with its emphasis on the organic character of the national soul as developed through the slow processes of the history of the folk. Though Herder, Rousseau, and the other ancestors of romantic nationalism had not preached the doctrine that the political nation needed to be identical with the organic folk, this connection was soon made, especially in Germany, where it first acted as a rallying cry against the advancing armies of Napoleon and then as a call to unifying that much-divided country. At its most conserva tive, romantic nationalism was a conscious counter­ revolution against the Enlightenment in favor of new key values, blood and soil. By the time Hegel had transmuted them into the abstruse language of his philosophy, his own nation, Germany, had become the Absolute, the incarna tion of the Idea . Even liberal romantic nationalism of the school of Mazzini, though in theory it was accepting of the equal righ ts of all nations, was more than casually aware that the various racial and folk strains had differing histories, destinies, and missions. As has been said above, the early versions of post-Emancipation Jewish thought had been grounded in the Enlightenmen t. They could react to the new romantic nationalism only defensively, by narrowing the focus of their claim to acceptance in society. The modem Jew no longer needed to prove, primarily, that h e had be­ come a man of the West, but that he was indeed a participant in the mystical essence of the German, or the French, etc., national soul. We therefore find the leaders of German Reform Judaism asserting with ever greater vehemence by the 1 84o’s that Berlin was their new Jerusalem, “the fa therland to which we cling with all the bonds of love.”14 But acceptance on these terms was much harder to achieve. Jewish apologetics could create a convincing case for the historic right of the Jew to regard himself as one of the cofounders of European civilization as a whole, but it could not really claim, with any effectiveness, any share in the folk-soul fashioned in the Teutonic forests or in the glory of Charlemagne’s martial exploits . In the eyes of conservative and reactionary nationalism the Jew might indeed be regarded as truly westernized, but he was a cosmopolitan, debarred 1 4See Philipson, op. cit., p. 233.”

Tite only hope he had was in the victory of liberal na tionalism, to which the past was less important than the future of the nation . That is why the French and American revolutions re­ mained almost the sacred symbols of modern Jewish thought, even in the age of nationalism. America embarked in 1 789 on a new national history which had no past for reaction to look to, and France had radically broken with its earlier history in its great convulsion. Liberal French nationalism looked forward from 1 789, and, when powerful forces of reaction looked back to earlier ages in the Dreyfus affair, the last ally of the policy of Jewish assimilation was shaken and the stage was set for Herzl and the continuous history of Zionism -but we are running ahead of our story. Neither anti-Semitism nor nationalism, as such, were the precon­ ditions for modern Zionism . The situation within which it arose was the split within nationalism, the crystallization of its warring con­ servative-reactionary and liberal varieties. So individual outbreaks of an ti-Semitism, like the notorious blood libel in Damascus in 1 840 rippled the surface of Hess’s composure, but, as he tells us, it did no more than that.l5 By 1 8 5 3, however, modern racism had already publ ished its classic, Gobineau’s Essai sur l’inegalite des races hu­ maines, which argued that the Aryan was inherently superior. It was soon followed by an active and full-blown racial anti-Semitism repre­ sented, in the next two decades, by Richard Wagner in art and by Georg von Schoenerer, the founder of Pan-Germanism, in politics. Hess was the first Jewish thinker to take this new doctrine seriously : not that he foresaw its full implications in terror and genocide that were to appear in the twentieth century, but that he recognized that racism would be more than strong enough to prohibit the integration of the Jew as individual into the various national societies. Conservative nationalism, in its most con temporary ( in the 1 8 5o’s and 1 86o’s ) racist manifestations, provided Hess with the answer to assimila tionism-but he still had to reckon with the policy of religious Reform. His counter to its basic notion, that Judaism be made into a purely un iversal religion stripped of all particularism, derives from one of the fathers of nationalism, from Herder. Its essence is a con­ ception of reli gion which is rooted in Herder’s well-known question : “Do not nations differ in everything, in poetry, physiognomy and tastes, customs and languages? Must not religion, which partakes of 15See text, Part 1.”

* “I N T R O D UCT I O N      � all these, also differ among nations?“ There is, therefore, no such thing as a valid universal religion; there is only a universal morality ( on this point, Hess regards himself as a follower of Spinoza ) . This ethic, based on universal reason, is variously reflected in the true ultimate units of society, the nations which unite in their essences all of the categories of blood, history, faith, and sovereignty. Ancient Judaism was the first group in human history to create such an identity, and the new era laboring to be born ”can look only to Judaism as its pattern and spiritual example     •   •for, in reality, the .”

* “that at a very early period the Prophets taught it to respect only the power of the spirit and not to worship material power.“29 What Ahad Ha-Am is thus, in effect, proposing is a dual explanation of national­ ism : there is nationalism in general, that of power, which is a genus comprising many species and individuals-i.e., all the nations of the world; counterposed to it there is the nationalism of the spirit, a unique genus of which there is only one species, the Jewish. It nec­ essarily follows that the main axis of history is, indeed, as defined by Nietzsche ( and the Pan-Slavs ) , the hatred of the sword for the book. Having pridefully chosen his side, Ahad Ha-Am, as the supremely self-conscious modem spokesman for the spirit of the book, could only proceed to devise a strategy that would a nswer the contemporary situation. He defined it in two parts : to continue the miracle of makeshifts by which the Jew had preserved himself for many centuries in the face of power and to put his best energies into refreshing and reformulating his spiritual tradition. 2 8Simon, op. cit., pp. 76-82.”

As an intellectual who felt himself predestined to fail in practical affairs, it was not strange that he conceived his utopia as a quiescent Jewish society organized to admire the “men of the spirit.” His distrust of the masses belongs to the same cast of mind because, like Plato before him, he knew all too well that philosopher­ kings can almost never win an election. But Ahad Ha-Am was not merely romanticizing himself into a new elite by leaping across the centuries to claim that, after a lapse of fifteen hundred years, he was the harbinger of a resurrected breed of Pharisees. The more recent inner history of the ghetto had largely turned on the conflict between the dominant minority of the well-born and the scholars of the reli­ gious tradition, whom the rich generally obeyed, and the masses. ( Let it be added, parenthetically, that this too little studied class war is a root cause of much of modem Jewish history and that the tensions that resulted from it have not yet vanished, but detailed discussion of this question is not immediately relevant in the present context. ) In ghetto terms, Ahad Ha-Am ranked as a hidalgo and he remained pre­ disposed to believe that Jewish history had always been and would remain the story of his class. As we shall soon see, the intellectual content of his theory of Jewish spiritual nationalism is, on basic mat­ ters, evasive or self-contradictory. What lent unity to his position on the inner affairs of Jewry was something he never quite acknowledged; it was his attempt, amidst all the new turbulences of the nineteenth century, to defend the pre-eminence of his class. In western Europe the battle had been lost at least a half century earlier, when the recently emancipated Jewish communities began to look, as a matter of course, to new men as their mentors _and spokes­ men. The nineteenth-century age of revolution had announced the end of the pre-eminence of the nobility and the clergy within Euro­ pean society as a whole; the Jewish counterpart of this event was a rebellion against the old elite headed by the scholars of the synagogue. Th e older hero of piety, who could be chosen only by the in-group, was displaced by the new hero of secular achievement, who was in­ evitably ( for a minority group not in control of its own political and economic life ) a creation of real or imagined gentile regard. One effect of this new standard was to release the wealthy, for the first time in Jewish history, from any remaining restraints imposed on their will by rabbis; they could now be checked, as H erzl knew pre-eminently well, only by organizing the masses against them.

In addition there are two articles that strikingly illustrate the con trasting passions of this debate; I therefore add two excerpts from these articles published in Forum, the occasional journal created by the World Zionist Organization in 1 9 5 3 for the discussion of these issues. In Number z ( April 1 9 5 6 ) the American Zionist leader, I rving Miller, wrote : “The original principles of the movement have been forgotten, to the point where it is hardly believed today that to the founders of Zionism a Jewish state was not an end in i tself, but merely an indispensable means for the rejuvenation of the Jewish spirit, of Jewish life and culture.

Israel ’s too ready scorn for Zionists and the World Zionist Organization ill ustrates the poore�t means for cementing the solidarity of all Jewry. “ As i f to leave no douht that these comments were addressed to him, Ben·Gurion wrote a few months later ( N umber 3. August 1 9 5 7 ) from his temporary retreat i n Sde Boker : ” I t i s doubtful whether there i s any remedy for the old gc.neration of Zionists in the Diaspora . . . This does not mean that there is no hope for a movement of personal implementation in the Diaspora”

Every American Jew of our time-if one describes him in the parlance of our own exaggerated and grotesque terms-is a free-orthodox-cosmopolitan-assimilationist-na­ tionalist-Zionist thinker. The dividing lines, which the previous genera­ tions have so laboriously marked out, are erased in the mind of this Jew; the magic circle has been broken into and now already belongs to the past.“80 For our immediate purpose it is not important to decide whether Arlosoroff’s impressions of the American Jewish community were cor­ rect and clairvoyant (be it mentioned that they were largely ignored in the Palestinian circles to which they were addressed ) . However, he was certainly right on one point, that American Zionist thought was ideologically eclectic. So in 1944> under the impact of Hitler’s murder of the Jews of Europe, Abba Hillel Silver, the most classical political Zionist among the Americans, went very far in applying the categories of Herzl to the immediate scene he was surveying. He argued, in orthodox fashion, that anti-Semitism would be a constant even in America : ”The New World, for a time, made possible a pleasant sense of almost complete identification.

* “TI1is is the essential insight of the greatest religious mystic of modem Zionist and Jewish thought, Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook : “It is a gra ve error to be insensitive to the distinctive unity of the Jewish spirit . . . This error is the source of the attempt to sever the national from the religious element of Judaism. Such a division would falsify both our nationalism and our religion . . . No matter what they [i.e., the secular nationalists ] may think, the particular element of the Jewish spirit that they may make their own, being rooted in the total life of our people, must inevitably contain every aspect of its ethos . . . . Once this truth is established, our opponents will ulti­ mately have to realize that they were wa s ting their efforts. The values they attempted to banish were nonetheless present, if only in an attenuated and distorted foxm, in their theories . . . ” 7 8 Kook is echoed in this view by the unorthodox religious philoso­ pher, Martin Buber: “There is no re-establishing of Israel, there is no security for it save one : It must assume the burden of its own unique­ ness; it must assume the yoke of the kingdom of God. Since this can be accomplished only in the rounded life of a commun i ty, we must reassemble, we must again root in the soil, we must govern ourselves. But these are mere prerequisites! Only when the community recog­ n izes and realizes them as such in its own life will they serve as the cornerstones of its salvation.”711 And a comparable conviction suffuses the outlook of the agnostic mystic of nature and labor, A. D. Gordon : “What, then, is that elusive, unique, and persistent force that will not die and will not let us die   .   •   .7 There is a primal force within every one of us, which is fighting for its own life, which seeks its own realization . . .

* “1 T 1 s w R 1 T T E N in the Bible: “ Retu rn, 0 Lord, unto the tens and thousands of the families of Israel.”1 On this verse the rabbis com­ mented in the Talmud2 as follows : it proves that the Divine Presence can be felt only if there are at least two thousands and two tens of thousands of Israelites together. Yet we pray every day : “Let our eyes behold Thy return in mercy unto Zion.”8 Upon whom should the Divine Presence rest? On sticks and stones? Therefore, as the first step in the reden.ption of our souls, we must cause at least twenty-two thousand to return to the Holy Land. This is the necessary prepa­ ration for a descent of the Divine Presence among us; afterward, He will grant us and all Israel further signs of His favor. “And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem . . . and he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent.”4 We must ask : Why did Jacob buy this land, since, being on his way to his father, Isaac, he had no intention of living there? Obviously, he performed this act to teach his descendants that the soil of the Holy Land must be pu rchased from its non·Jewish owners. We, as a people, are properly called Israel only in the land of Israel. In the first conquest, under Joshua, the Almigh ty brought the children of Israel into a land that was prepared : its houses were then full of useful things, its wells were giving water, and its vineyards and olive groves were laden with fruit. This new Redemption will-alas, because of our sins-be different: our land is waste and desolate, and we shall have to build houses, dig wells, and plant vines and olive trees. We are, therefore, commanded not to attempt to go at once and all together to the Holy Land. In the first place, it is necessary for many Jews to remain for a time in the lands of dispersion, so that they can help the first settlers in Palestine, who will undoubtedly come from among the poor. Secondly, the Lord desires tha t we be re­ deemed in dignity; we cannot, therefore, migrate in a mass, for we should then have to live like Bedouins, scattered in tents all over the fields of the Holy Land. Redemption must come s l ow l y. The land must, by degrees, be built up and prepared.”

This province was the western part of Poland, which Prussia had acquired in the second partition of that country in 1793. In Jewish life this region was the border between the older Jewish ghetto culture of the traditional pieties and learning, which Kalischer represented in his person with great distinction, and the newer milieu of western European Jewry, which was rapidly enter­ ing modern secular life. Nationalism was the major force of European history during the whole of Kalischer’s adult life, but he was particu­ larly aware of it because of his geographic position. In 1 8 3o-1831 and again in 1 863 unsuccessful revolts occurred across the border in the Russian part of Poland in attempts to re-establish the independence of the Poles. Jewish population in this region was numerically signifi­ cant, and in some places, including Warsaw during the two Polish revolutions, it was of political, and even military, importance whether the Jews would regard themselves as Poles, Russians, or as a separate nationality. Kalischer’s early career coincided with the rise of the Reform move­ ment in Judaism, which was calling for the abandonment of many of the inherited beliefs and rituals. He participated in these controversies as a convinced defender of the inherited tradition and especially of the commandments prescribing the faith in the Messiah and emphasizing the special relationship of the Jew to the Holy Land. Though most of his literary activity was in the genre of talmudic legalism, of which he was an acknowledged master, he published a philosophical work and even produced one article in defense of Maimonides ( it appeared in German transla tion in 1 846 ) . His first expression of Zionism is to be found in a letter that he wrote in 1 8 36 to the head of the Berlin branch of the Rothschild family. There he explained that “the beginning of the Redemption”

The Almighty, blessed be His Na me, will not suddenly descend from on high and command His people to go forth. He will not send the Messiah from heaven in a twinkling of an eye, to sound the great trumpet for the scattered of Israel and gather them into Jerusalem . He will not surround the Holy City with a wall of fire or cause the Holy Temple to descend from the heavens. The bliss and the miracles that were promised by His servants, the prophets, will certainly come to pass-everything will be fulfilled-but we will not run in terror and Bight, for the Redemption of Israel will come by slow degrees and the ray of deliverance will shine forth grad­ ually. My dear reader! Cast aside the conventional view that the Messiah will suddenly sound a blast on the great trumpet and cause all the inhabitants of the earth to tremble. On the contrary, the Redemption will begin by awakening support among the philanthropists and by gaining the consent of the nations to the gathering of some of the scattered of Israel into the Holy Land. 11te prophet Isaiah ( 2 7 : 6 and 1 2-1 3 ) expressed this thought as fol­ lows : “In the days to come shall Jacob take root, Israel shall blossom and bud; and the face of the world shall be filled with fruitage. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord will beat off his fruit from the flood of the River unto the Brook of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, 0 ye children of Israel. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great hom shall be blown; and they that were lost in the land of Assyria, and they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship the Lord in the holy mountain at J eru­ salem .” He thus revealed that all of Israel would not return from exile at one time, but would be ga thered by degrees, as the gra in is sl o w l y ga thered from the beaten com .

Most of them came from distant shores, risking their very lives for the privilege of living in the Holy Land. In this country, which is strange to them, how could they go about finding a business or an occupation, when they had never in their lives done anything of this kind? Their eyes can only tum to their philanthropic brethren, of whom they ask only enough to keep body and soul together, so that they can dwell in that Land which is God’s portion on earth. Yet, in order to silence this argument once and for all, I would suggest that an organization be established to encourage settlement in the Holy Land, for the purpose of purchasing and cultivating farms and vineyards. Such a program would appear as a ray of deliverance to those now living in the Land in poverty and famine. The pittance that is gathered from the entire Jewish world for their support is not enough to satisfy their hunger; indeed, in Jerusalem, the city which should be a source of blessing and well-being, many pious and saintly people are fainting of hunger in the streets. The situation would be different if we were inspired by the fervor of working the land with our own hands. Surely, God would bless .our labor and there would be no need to import grain from Egypt and other neighboring countries, for our harvest would prosper greatly.

However, even though Hess was suffi­ ciently active in the German revolution of 1848 to earn the sentence of death, the Communist Manifesto of that year sealed the break that had been implicit for a number of years between him and Marx and Engels. Hess was never in agreement with materialistic determinism , for his own socialism was of the ethical variety, the expression of a romantic love for man. That Karl Marx knew this and disapproved is evident in the Communist Manifesto itself, for he takes pains to mock Hess in that historic essay. Hess’s early Paris years were marked by the most bizarre aspect of his personal life. Evidently out of the desire to make personal atone­ ment for the sins of man which drove poor women into the “oldest profession,” he married a lady of the streets-and, somewhat surpris­ ingly, lived happily ever after. I t is not surprising, however, that this completed his personal breach with his father and family in Cologne. By 1853 Hess was back in Paris, where he remained for the rest of his days. Though he did not abandon socialism, he devoted himself to scientific studies. As he delved into anthropology he became firmly convinced that the fu tu re world order needed to be organized as a harmonious symphony of national cultures, each expressing in its own way the ethical socialism which remained his quasi-religious fai th . A rekindled interest in the fai th and fate of his own people brought him back to Jewish studies and the result was the publica tion in 1862 of his Rome and Jerusalem. This diffuse short volume contains echoes of all of his ideas, including his general theory of national socialism for all peoples and his vitalistic views of science ( these were published in full posthumously in 1 877 by his wife under the title Dynamic Mat­ ter ) . Its major importance is, of course, in his statement of Jewish nationalism. Though Hess’s later years were productive of many other essays on Jewish question s, Rome and ferusczlem is his classic, and the excerpts below are all from that volume.”

* “would have deserved that the Torah be given to Israel through him. had not Moses preceded him.“ In the form in which we possess it to day, the Torah was handed down to us directly through the men of that second epoch. These same men, living at the same time, utilizing the same traditions, and in the same spirit, collected both the written and the oral law, which they handed down to later generations. There is no justification for ascribing a holier origin to the written law than to the oral. On the contrary, from the time of the return from the Babylonian exile the living development of the oral law was always considered of greater importance than the mere clinging to the written law. The reason for this is quite evident. The national legislative gen­ ius would have been extinguished, had the sages not occupied them­ selves with the living development of the law. It was to this activity that Judaism owed its national renaissance after the Babylonian exile, as well as its continuing existence in the Diaspora of tha t day. It was through this that the great Jewish heroes arose, who fought so bravely against the Greek and Roman enemies of their nation. And, finally, it is to this oral developmen t of the law that Judaism owes its existence during the two thousand years of exile; and to it the Jewish people will also owe its future national regenera tion. The rabbis were justified in their long struggle against writing down the oral law. Had they kept on teaching and developing the law orally in the schools, Judaism would never have been threatened with the loss of its national legisla tive genius. But they were compelled to reduce the law to writing in order to avoid a still greater danger, namely, its being entirely forgotten because of the dispersion of the Jews. Today, we have no reason to fear the latter danger. But we can escape the former only if we revive the critical spirit to counteract barren formalism, and if we reawaken in our hearts and souls the holy, patriotic spirit of our prophets and sages, as an antidote to destructive rationalism . Our people must once again steep itself in its history, which has been grossly neglected by our rationalists, and rekindle in the hearts of our younger generation that spirit which was the ultimate source of wisdom and inspiration for both our prophets and our rabbis. If we begin once again to draw our inspiration from the ultimate sources of Judaism, our doctors of the law will regain among us the authority which they justly forfeited from the moment when, prompted by motives other than patriotism, they estranged themselves from Judaism and attempted to reform Jewish law.

Is not everything being made even and prepared; is not the road of civilization being laid in the desert by the digging of the Suez Canal, and by the work on a railroad which will connect Europe and Asia? To be sure, none of this reflects any intention to re-establish our nation, but you know the proverb : Man proposes and God disposes. What we have to do at present for the regeneration of the Jewish nation is, first, to keep alive the hope of the political rebirth of our people, and, next, to reawaken that hope where it slumbers. When political conditions in the Orient shape themselves so as to permit the organization of a beginning of the restoration of a Jewish state, this beginning will express itself in the founding of Jewish colonies in the land of their ancestors, to which enterprise France will un­ doubtedly lend a hand. France, beloved friend, is the savior who will restore our people to its place in universal history. Just as we once searched in the West for a road to India, and incidentally discovered a new world, so will our lost fatherland be rediscovered on the road to India and China that is now being built in the Orient. Do you still doubt that France will help the Jews to found colonies which may extend from Suez to Jerusalem and from the banks of the Jordan to the coast of the Mediterranean? Then pray read the work which appeared shortly after the massacres in Syria12 written by Laharanne and published by the famous publisher, Dentu, under the title The New Eastern Question, The author hardly wrote it at the request of the French Government but he acted in accordance with the spirit of the French nation when he urged our brethren, not on religious grounds but from purely political and humanitarian motives, to restore their ancient State. I may, therefore, recommend this work, written not by a Jew but by a French patriot, to the attention of our modem Jews, who plume themselves on an attachment to an humanity, a sentiment they bor­ rowed from the French people. I will quote here a few pages of this work, The New Eastern Question, by Ernst Laharanne.18 ”No member of the Jewish race can renounce the incontestable and fundamental right of his people to its ancestral land without”

And we, having seen that all this did not get us anywhere, and that it did not even help us secure the love we sought-we declare : Only a dog neither has nor wants a home. A man who chooses to live his whole life as a transient, without a thought for the establishment of a permanent home for his children, will for­ ever be regarded as a dog. And we must seek a home with all our hearts, our spirit, our soul. If we succeed in reviving this desire in the heart of every one of us, then we may hope that in time men of action will arise among the desirers who will realize this dream.

I am aware that your m otives, s ir, in adopt i ng such a position are of the h ig hes t. You saw our youth abandoning the tongue of their ancestors, so you quickly developed arguments calculated to put an end to this evil. You therefore st ruck out on a new path and a ss er t ed a new t heo ry-that we are a spiritual nation and that our life is different from the lives of all other peoples , for Israel’s life is only in its s p i rit, t hi s spi rit is only in its Torah, and this Torah can be expressed onl y in the p eopl e’s own language; and, therefore, if we forsake our langua ge, we forsake our sp i ri t- a nd, by so doi ng, we would be doomed to death ! However, for your t h eo ry to stand, all these a s su mp tions must be true : tha t we are a sp i ri tu a l people, that our spirit is only in our Torah, and tha t our Torah can be ex p ress ed only in our tongue. But on what, s i r, do you base all your assumptions? In your desire to save your nation from the deadly bite of the M a s kil im of Berlin, you crea ted these as s u mp tion s in your own keen mind.

O n the other hand, the non-Jews, instead of relying simply upon their superior force and holding fast to their his­ torical and actual standpoint-the standpoint of the stronger-try to justify their negative attitude by a mass of accusations which, on closer examination, prove to be baseless or negligible. He, however, who de­ sires to be unbiased, who does not desire to judge and interpret the affairs of this world according to the principles of an utopian Arcadia, but would merely ascertain and explain them in order to reach a con­ clusion of practical value, will not make either of the parties seriously responsible for the antagonism described. To the Jews, however, in whom we are chiefly interested, he will say : “You are foolish, because you stand awkwardly by and expect of human nature something which it has always lacked-humanity. You are contemptible, because you have no real self-love and no national self-respect.” National self-respect! Where can we obtain it? It is truly the greatest misfortune of our race that we do not constitute a nation, that we are merely Jews. We are a flock scattered over the whole face of the earth, without a shepherd to protect us and gather us together. Under the most favorable circumstances we reach the rank of those privileged goats which, according to Russian custom, are stabled among race horses. And that is the highest goal of our ambition. It is true that our loving protectors have always taken good care that we should never catch our breath and recover our self-respect. As in­ dividual Jews, but not as a Jewish na tion, we have carried on for centuries the hard and unequal struggle for existence. Single-handed each separate individual had to waste his genius and his energy for a little oxygen and a morsel of bread, moistened with tears. In this hope­ less struggle we did not succumb. We waged the most glorious of all partisan struggles with all the peoples of the earth who, with one ac­ cord, desired to exterminate us. But the war we have waged-and God knows how long we shall continue to wage it-has not been for a fatherland, but for the wretched existence of millions of “Jew ped­ dlers.” If all the peoples of the earth were not able to blot out our existence, they were nevertheless able to destroy in us the feeling of our national independence. And as for ourselves, we look on with fa talistic indiffer­ ence when in many a land we are refused a recognition which would not lightly be denied to Zulus.

* “is powerful enough to propel a large engine and to move passengers and goods, let the engine have whatever form it may. I am profoundly convinced that I am right, though I doubt whether I shall live to see myself proved so. Those who today inaugurate this movement are unlikely to live to see its glorious culmination. But the very inauguration is enough to inspire in them a high pride and the joy of an inner liberation of their existence. To avoid all suspicion of Utopianism, I shall also be very sparing of pictures que details in my exposition. I expect, in any case, that un­ thinking scoffers will caricature my sketch in an attempt to vitiate the whole idea. A Jew, of excellent judgment in other respects, to whom I explained my plan, remarked that “I t is the hallmark of U topias to present facets of the future as facts in present reality.” This is a mis­ take. Every finance minister bases his budget estima tes on future figures, and not only on projections of the actual average returns of previous years, or on previous revenues in other states, but sometimes on figures for which there is no precedent wha tever; as, for example, in instituting a new tax. Anyone who has examined a budget knows that this is so. But is such a financial draft considered Utopian, even when we know that the estima tes will never be rigidly adhered to? But I e x pect far more of my readers. I ask the cultivated men whom I address to set aside many preconceptions. I shall even go so far as to ask those Jews who have most earnestly tried to solve the Jewish ques­ tion to look upon their previous a ttempts as mistaken and impracti­ cable. There is one danger I must guard against in the presentation of my idea. If I am restrained in describing all these things that lie in the future, I may appear to be doubting the possibility of their ever being realized. If, on the other hand, I speak of them quite unreserve d l y as realized, I may appear to be building castles in the air. I therefore sta te, clearly and emphatically, that I believe in the achievemen t of the idea, though I do not profess to have dis cov ered the shape it may ultima tely take. The world needs the Jewish S t a t e; therefore it will arise. The plan would seem mad enough if a single individual we re to undertake it; but if many Jews simultaneously a gree on it, it is en tire ly reasonable, and its achievement presen ts no difficulties wort h m e n· tioning. The idea depends only on the number of its adh e rent s Pe r· .”

TI1ough perhaps we could succeed in vanishing without a trace into the surrounding peoples if they would let us be for just two generations. But they will not let us be. After brief periods of toleration, their hostility erupts again and again. When we prosper, it seems to be unbearably irritating, for the world has for many centuries been accustomed to regarding us as the most degraded of the poor. Thus out of ignorance or il1 will they have failed to observe that prosperity weakens us as Jews and wipes away our differences. Only pressure drives us back to our own; only hostility stamps us ever again as strangers. Thus we are now, and shall remain, whether we would or not, a group of unmistakable cohesiveness. We are one people-our enemies have made us one whether we will or not, as has repeatedly happened in history. Affliction binds us to­ gether, and thus united, we suddenly discover our strength. Yes, we are strong enough to form a State, and, indeed, a model State. We possess all the requisite human and material resources. This would, accordingly, be the appropriate place to give an ac­ count of what has been somewhat crudely termed our “human material.” But it would not be appreciated till the broad outlines of the plan, on which everything depends, have first been marked out.”

* “must first declare him to be mad.“ All kinds of vices are falsely at­ tributed to the Jews, because people want to prove to themselves that they have a right to detest them. But the primary sentiment is the detestation of the Jews. I must express the painful thought: The nations which emancipated the Jews have deluded themselves as to their own feelings. In order to produce its full effect, emancipation should first have been realized in sentiment before it was proclaimed by Jaw. But this was not the case. The history of Jewish emancipation is one of the most remarkable pages in the history of European thought. The emancipation of the Jews was not the result of a conviction that grave injury had been done to a people, that it had been shockingly treated, and tha t it was time to a tone for the injustice of a thousand years; it was solely the result of the geometrical mode of thought of French rationalism of the eight­ eenth century. Without reference to sentiment and emotion, this ra­ tionalism, operating with logic alone, laid down principles as axiomatic as those of mathematics; it insisted upon trying to introduce these creations of pure intellect into the world of reality. The emancipation of the Jews was an example of the automatic application of the ration­ alistic method. The philosophy of Rousseau and the Encyclopedists1 has Jed up to the declaration of human rights. The strict logic of the men of the Great Revolution deduced Jewish emancipation from this declaration. They formulated a logicaJiy correct sy11ogism : Every man is born with certain rights; the Jews are human being�. consequently the Jews by nature possess the rights of man . In this manner, the emancipation of the J ews was proclaimed in France, not out of fra­ ternal feeling for the Jews but because logic demanded it. Popular sentiment indeed rebeJied, but the philosophy of the Revolution de­ creed that principles must be placed above sentimen t. May I be per­ mitted to say something which implies no ingratitude : The men of 1 7922 emancipated us only for the sake of logic. In the same way that the French Revolution gave to the world the metric and the decimal systems, it also created a kind of normal spirit­ ual scale which other countries, either willingly or unwillingly, ac­ cepted as the normal measure of their cultural level . A country which laid claim to cultural a ttainment had to possess several institutions created or developed by the Grea t Revol ution, as, for insta n ce, repre­ senta tive government, freedom of the press, trial by jury, division of powers, etc. J ewish emancipation was also one of these indispensable furnishings of a highly cultured s ta te, like a piano which is a requi re d article of furniture in a drawing room, even if not a single member of”

* “was nourished by the same folk-tradition that sustained the whole of the nation within which he had become a citizen. AU at once, twenty years ago, after a slumber of thirty to sixty years, anti-Semitism once more sprang out of the innermost depths of the nations of western Europe. It revealed to a mortified Jew, who thought anti-Semitism was gone forever, the true picture of his situation. He was still allowed to vote for members of Parliament, but he saw himself excluded, with varying degrees of politeness, from the clubs and gatherings of his Christian fellow countrymen . He was allowed to go wherever he pleased, but eve rywhere he encountered the sign : “No Jews admitted.” He still had the right of discharging all the duties of a citizen, but the nobler rights which are gra n ted to talent and energy were absolutely denied him. Such is the con temporary situation of the emancipated Jew in west­ ern Europe. He has abandoned his specifically Jewish character, yet the nations do not accept him as part of their national communities. He flees from his Jewish fellow, because anti-Semitism has taught him, too , to be contemptuous of them, but his gen tile compatriots repulse him as he attempts to associate with them. He has lost his home in the gh etto yet the land of his birth is denied to him as his home. He has no ground under his feet and he has no community to which he belongs as a welcome and full y accepted member. He cannot count on justice from his Christian countrymen as a reward for either his character or his achievements, and still less on the basis of any existing good feeling; he has lost his connection with other Jews. Inevitably he feels tha t the world ha tes him and he sees no place where he can find the warmth for which he longs and seeks. This is the Jewish spi ri tual misery, which is more painful than the physical because it affects men of higher station, who are p roud e r and more sensitive. The emancipated Jew is insecure in his relations with his fellow man, timid with strangers, and suspicious even of the secret feelings of his friends. H is best powers are dissipated in suppress i ng and destroying, or at least in the d i fficul t task of co n cealing his true character. He fears that this character might be recognized as Jewish, and he never has the satisfaction of revealing himself as h e is in his real identity, in every thought and sentiment, in every phys i ca l gesture. He has become a cripple within, and a counter fei t person without, so that like everythi n g unreal, he is ridiculous and hateful to all men of h igh standards.

Hence the community of Israel became “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,” destined from the very beginning to be an example to the whole of mankind through its Torah. This solution of the problem left no room in Ju da ism for the two extreme views. Man is one and indivisible; all his limbs, his senses, his emotions, his thoughts constitute a single whole. But the exis tence of the man who is a Jew is not purposeless, because he is a member of the people of Israel, which exists for a sublime purpose. And as the community is only the sum of its members, every Israelite is en­ titled to regard himself as an i n disp en sable link in the chain of his people’s life and as sharing in his people’s imperishability. That is why true asceticism is unknown in the early period of Jewish history. True asceticism, hatred of the Oesh and the desire for its annihilation, is possible only where men, unable to find the purpose of life in this world, are compelled to look for it in another. It is true that in early Jewish life there were Nazarites, who observed certain of the outward practices of asceticism; but this was simply part of the ritual of sacrifice and had nothing to do with hatred of the Oesh. It must be remembered that even so unascetic a hero as Samson was reckoned a Nazarite. This attitude to life, which lifts the individual above the love of self and teaches him to find th e purpose of his existence in the per­ petuation and well-being of the community, is regarded by many non­ Jewish students o f religi on as overmaterialistic; and on the s tren gth of it they pronounce Judaism inferior, because it does not, like other religions, promise immortal life to everybody and a reward to the righteous a ft er death.

Needless to say, if the political ideal is not attained, it will have disastrous consequences, because we shall have lost the old basis without fi nding a new one. But even if it is attained under present conditions, when we are a scattered people not only in the physical but also in the spiritual sense-even then, J u daism will be in great danger. Almost all our great men-those, that is, whose education and social position have p repared them to be at the head of a Jewish State-are spiritually far removed from Judaism and have no true conception of its nature and its value. Such men, however loyal to their State and devoted to its interests, will necessarily envisage those interests by the standards of the foreign culture which they themselves have imbibed; and they will endeavor, by moral persuasion or even by force, to implant that culture in the Jewish State, so that in the end the Jewish State will be a State of Gennans or Frenchmen of the Jewish race. We have even now a small example of this process in Palestine. History teaches us that in the days of the Herodian house Pal es tine was indeed a Jewish State, but the national culture was despised and persecuted.

* “forward as a completely satisfactory solution of our problem, it l1as to promise to nonnalize the life of the scattered and atomized Jewish people. It has to undertake to provide the Jewish people with both the opportunity and the necessary strength of will to deploy its crea­ tive faculties to the maximum extent in the development of its specific na tional cul ture. Nor is that all. It has to guarantee the pos­ sibility of educating all the individual members of the people, in every rank of society, on the lines of the national culture, so as to ensure that when they reach ma turity they will find within the circle of the national life so wide a range of intellectual interests, and such ample scope for practical activity, that they will feel neither the need nor the desire to desert that sphere for another. Now it may be that autonomists of the Yiddishist school believe that national autonomy can satisfy these requirements. For them our na tional culture means Yiddish literature, na tional edU<.a tion means speaking Yiddish, and the na tional ideal is to reach the level of nations like the Letts or the Slovaks, which have not as yet made any con­ tribution whatever to the general stock of human culture. If “Nation­ alists” of this type regard autonomy in the Diaspora as the perfect solution of our problem, we can more or less understand their point of view. But it is otherwise with Nationalists who have a historical perspective-who demand that the future of our nation shall be a continuation of its past, and date the beginning of our national history from the Exodus from Egypt, not from the birth of the Yid­ dish novel and drama. Such Nationalists cannot be satisfied with a future that would put the greatness of our past to shame, and con­ sequently they must see that the sort of exiguous l iving-space that might perhaps suffice for the infant toddlings of a nation of yesterday cannot provide elbow-room for the cultural life of the “eternal people,” which has an ancient heritage of spiritual values and a fund of creative energy too large to be pent up within its own narrow confines. It is with Nationalists of this kind alone that I am here con­ cerned, and they, I feel sure, would not subscribe to the obviously untenable view tha t autonomy can perform all these miracles. At any rate, pending an explicit sta temen t on their part that they do subscribe to that view, I feel that to develop the arguments against it would be pushing an open door. It may, then, be taken as practically certain that the autonomists admit that national autonomy in the Diaspora cannot give us the possibility of a full and complete national life; their contention is that nonetheless, if we wish to survive, we must struggle for na tional rights”

* “in the Diaspora, so as to broaden the basis of our national life to the greatest possible exten t. I t is, however, common ground that at best we cannot get all we really need, and that our national culture and education must remain fragmentary and distorted, for lack of suffi­ cient elbow-room within the framework of the alien culture which hems us in on every side. If the autonomist doctrine is put in this more modest form, I doubt whether any true Jew will be opposed to it, in the sense of not regard­ ing the extension of our national rights in the Diaspora as something to be desired and to be worked for whenever possible. Any opposition to it must be based on the view that it is objectively impossible; that our position among the nations is unique, and that the rest of the world will never be induced to admit that we have national righ ts in the territories that belong to other nations. True, the autonomists are fond of comparing our position with that of other small nations in Russia, Austria, and elsewhere, of which some have achieved autonomy and others hope to acquire it some day. But what is the use of our forgetting the difference between ourselves and the other small nations if those with whom the decision rests will not forget it? Each of the other small nations in question has lived in its na tional territory for generations and was once independent. The independence has gone, but even the new overlords cannot deny the historic right of the indigenous people, or regard i ts nationality as a foreign growth on the very soil on which it first came to birth. And if in the course of time some branches of the national tree have spread into the neigh­ boring fields, without losing their connection with the parent stem, that is a perfectly natural and normal historic process. But we Jews entered every one of the lands of our dispersion as a foreign people, with a national culture which had been born and developed else­ where. Wandering beggars from a distan t clime, we have been com­ passionately granted asylum by the nations of the earth; but there never was, and is not now, any nexus between the life into which we have been admitted and the Jewish type of life which we brought with us, already fully developed, on our arrival. For this reason it is not likely that the world will recognize “the historic right of an alien people to live a national life of its own in a country of which from the very first it has never thought ( and still less has anybody else ever though t ) as belonging to itself. Ownership is after all a matter of convention; so long as individual ownership is recognized, national ownership cannot be condemned.” This, however, is by the way.

By other names Feier­ man (i.e., Brenner) is the protagonist of every one of his succeeding novels and his desti ny is always the same: abortive begin ni n gs , un­ realized stri vings, and bitterness against himself and the world. Only once did Brenner permit himself a more hopeful conclusion. His first novel of Palestine, Mi-Kaan Umi-Kaan (From Here and There) con­ tains a counter-h ero, Aryeh Lapi dot, who was drawn in the image of A. D. Gordon (we shall meet him in the next section ) .

The sun shone; life was thorny; the account was still open.” Both in his art and in his perso nal life Brenner wandered between these two poles of the blackest pessimism and qualified affirmation. His childhood and youth were conventional-born in the Ukraine, edu­ cated in the usual orthodoxy, and then a break to general studies-but there seems to have been an extra dimension of poverty and personal suffering. He grew to matu rity in the 18()0‘S, during a particularly hope­ less period in the life of Russia and Russian Jewry. All thought of accommodation with the tsa rist regime was ended by then; there were o nly three alternatives-to labor for a revolution, to migrate wes twa rd , or to tum Zionist and go to Palestine.

Ethics came into the world for such a mission; the Jewish ethic is therefore the source of our concept of mission, which consists of a desire to spread the light of our ethic among all mankind. An ethic may originate within a national culture, but that is only a first stage, which it transcends, as it is pu rifi ed, by becoming the possession of man as an ind i vidual . The very virtue of an ethic is in its capacity for development towa rd a universal system; if it cannot so develop, its signi fi cance is nil and it loses its right to exist . This judgment, that th e spirit and doctrine of an ethic cannot de­ fine a people, implies that we cannot pin our national hopes on the power of the ethic of Juda ism. Perhaps it is strong enough always to maintain itself, but it has not the power to guarantee the survival of the people which bears it . Perhaps it generates sufficient energy to spread the spirit of Judaism in the world, bu t it is incapable of preserv­ ing the national character and identity of the Jewish people. We must conclude that the assimilation of our people is not an i m possibility . We cannot brush off the theory of assimilation as a solut ion of the Jewish problem by asserting that it is i mpossible for the Jewish people to assimilate. On the contrary, assimilation is very d efinitely possible. Now that the walls of our rel igio n have been b reached , the spirit of Judaism, its philosophy and Weltanscluluung. is not strong enough to erect a containing wall in the Galut and guarantee our national survival within its boundaries.”

* “pated Jewry soon disposed of its nationalism in order to create for i ts elf the theoretical basis for emancipation. This same Jewry, which but recently prayed thrice daily for its return to Jerusalem, became in toxicated with patriotic sentiments for the land in which it lived. It appeared as though bourgeois freedom and Jewish assimilation bad finally solved the old Jewish problem. But, in reality, the splendor of the solution lasted only as long as the reign of liberalism. The more the bourgeoisie, once it became the ruling class, betrayed the principles o f liberalism, the shakier the ideological underpinnings of the eman­ cipation became. The struggle for economic power, both of individual an d class, became the chief characteristic of modern bourgeois society, once it had discarded the higher principles of its revolutionary era as unnecessary burdens. The emancipation of the Jew and his admission to all aspects of active citizenship could not be harmonized with the principle of egotism which is basic to bourgeois society. Jewish eman­ cipation, therefore, began to evaporate together with the remains of liberalism. But it emphasized again that the emancipation of the Jews was, from the beginning, a result of logical conformity to the implica­ tion of a principle, rather than a real need. Titere is further proof of this in the fact that wherever the emancipation has depended on the state or society, it has not come to pass. What is the basis of modem Jew-hatred? In the Middle Ages it was difference in religion : the abyss separating Judaism and Christianity. Today, the fundamental doctrine of modem anti-Semitism is the con­ ftict of race. In other words, now that bourgeois society has come to regard religious conflict as passe, the imponderables of racial difference have been pressed into service. Contemporary Jew-hatred sails under the Bag of anti-Semitism, although it is the same ship, with the same crew. “The Jews are an incurably bad people, a people always seeking its own benefits and wanting to enslave the entire world, a people which, i n s pite of all its efforts to assimila te, still remains strange and hostile to the non-Jews. The Jew is the torchbearer of capitalism, exploitation, usury, and suppression. At the same time, he is also the yeast of history, upsetting and destroying all that is stable, the troublemaker inca rnate. In short, the Jewish people is the curse of humanity.” Such is the plaint of modern bourgeois society. B ut the unbiased observer must question this outcry and ask of bourgeois society : Is not the bourgeois Jew really your alter ego, in a som ewhat abler guise? Do you not find yourself reflected in him, and him in you? Does not the Jew exploit because he can, and do you”

* “against each other, whi1e Zionism ignores these economic differences, postulating a so-called unity of the Jewish nation. There can be no more foolish argument than to maintain that the Jewish class struggle conflicts with Zionism . ‘I110se who maintain this have invented ideo­ logical contradictions which bear no relation to reality. Why should the Jewish proletariat, which wil l be the first to be helped by Zionis m in the material sense, reject it merely because the other classes of Jewry have also adopted Zionism for na tional and ideological reasons? ’I11e class struggle does not exhaust all the expressions of social life. When a people is endangered, all parties unite to fight the outside enemy, though in normal times the classes fight each other. Likewise, within the limits of their higher principles, opposing parties unite in elections and form coalitions against in ternal enemies. Modern parlia­ mentarianism is based on this procedure. In every union of men for idealistic purposes, the struggle which divides man against man dis­ appears and higher fonns of solidarity emerge to the foreground. Class struggle is the main driving force of history, but it is a m isconception to explain all social life, in its manifold expressions, in tenns of this alone. All defensive, creative, and ideological activities are realized not through the class struggle but despite it. Zionism is a creative work of the Jews, and it, therefore, stands not in contradiction to the class struggle but beyond it. Zionism can be accepted by each and every class of Jews. The Jewish proletariat, the poor Jewish masses, the intelligentsia, and the middle class, can justifiably oppose a Jewish state which may be built on the principles of capitalism . True, the Jewish state, regard­ less of form, can greatly erase the Jewish problems, but the modem conscience is so much pcnneated by social and economic ideals that the Jewish masses will not accept, and rightly so, a capitalistic Jewish state. ‘I11e form of the Jewish state is the only debatable issue involved in Zionism. Zionism must be responsive to the opinion of the Jewish masses, for, without them, the movement will be stillborn. The wheels of the Jewish state cannot be turned without the strong a rms of the Jewish workers. Zionism must take into consideration the socialist bent of the middle class and intelligentsia . Zionism must of necessity fuse with socialism, for socialism is in complete hannony with the wishes and hopt”li of the Jewish masses. Sociological and technical factors make any other form of J ewish state impossible.”

An d even though in the last century some have arisen in our midst w ho ha ve denied this belief, tearing i t out of their hea rts and even erasin g it from their prayers, the masses of our people hold fast to this hope, for t he fulfillment of which they pray morning, noon, and night, a n d in w hich they find balm for their suffering. Of late certain ortho dox rab bis have arisen in western Europe, among whom one has even de­ cla red that the promises of future bliss and consolation made by our seers were in the fonn of symbols and parables. The coming of th e M essiah, they say, will not be to bring Israel back to the Land of i ts Fa th ers and put an end to its long dispersion and many sorrows, bu t wi ll be to establish the Kingdom of Heaven for all mankind, wh i le Israel continues in exile as a light to the gentiles.

I also know how much real knowledge can cont ribute to the ennobling of religious feeli ng. But knowledge divorced from faith is not w hat I consider a desirable goal. That is not th e enlightenment which our better leaders of the preceding genera­ tion declared to be the sister of faith, while their predecessors thought it th e handmaiden of faith. But a sister or a handmaid who sets herself up as a rival to her sister or her mistress will only lure the master away from his wife, without leaving even a small comer in his heart for the affection he once bore her. The enlightenment we seek i s one that is organically in tegrated in faith, so that the two are inseparable. Why should we try to isolate the one from the other? Have we not been given the Torah to teach us to purify our thoughts and our sentiments as the golds mith refines the gold? Has not reason been given us by Heaven so that we may be able to con template the greatness of our Creator as revea l ed in His work and the glory of the Law He implanted in our hearts? In the world of the spirit there are no compartments. Whatever the man thinks and feels, if it is directed toward Truth, is enveloped in holiness. Nor have you, the secularists, any monopoly on the Zionist senti­ ment. I am as much a Lover of Zion as you are, not a whit less. But mine is not the Love of Zion which you have abstracted from the whole Jewish tradition to set it up in a separate existence. Any othe r people can perhaps have a national aspiration divorced from its reli­ gion, but we, Jews, cannot. Such nationalism is an abomination to Jews. Moreo ver, it cannot succeed, since it has no roots in our reality. What is Jewish nationality divorced from Jewish religion? It is an empty formula, nothing but pretty phrases. After all, what is “nation­ ality” if not a concept, or, in other words, a thought-image. But a though t-image which has no basis in reality is an iilusion. What other ba sis in reality can there be for the thought-image of Jewish nationality excep t the unity of the Jewish people with its Torah and its faith? I know the answer you will give me: Our history and our language ]so � form part of our national heritage. True enough, a common pas t as a national heritage, but it i s n o t the begetter o f nationality. It is Un hea rd of for an effect to tum around and become the cause of its OWn cause!

The soul of Israel is full of the spirit of God, the spirit of the Na me, and no man who is responsive to the demands of his own soul can be silent at this great hour. He must cry out to the slumbering powers of our people : Awake and rise to your task. The voice of God calls out mightily. His call is attested in the recess es of our soul and by the changing processes of life : Israel must tap the source of its life, and plant itself on the feet of its spiritual character. World civilization is crumbling, the human spirit is weak­ ened, and darkness i s enveloping all the nations. The time is ripe. Everlasting light, the true Light of God, the Light o God of Israel, revealed by his wondrous people, must rise to the f level of consciousness. This awareness must penetrate the inner being of our people, so that it recognizes the ultimate oneness of its own potentialities and becomes aware of the God Who dwells in it. Once it knows that God is within it, our people will also know how to draw from its own elemen tal source. Our nation is called to drink not from alien wells but from its own deeps. Let it fill its vessels with will from the depth of its prayers, with life from the well of its Torah, with courage from the roots of its faith, with order from the integrity of its reason, and with heroism from the might of its spirit, for all that arises under the canopy of its skies derives from the spirit of God that is hovering over the universe, from the beginning unto the end of time. All the civilizations of the world will be renewed by the renascence of our spirit. All quarrels will be resolved, and our revival will cause all life to become luminous with the joy of fresh birth. All religions will don new and precious raiment, casting off whatever is soiled, abominable, and unclean; they will unite in imbibing of the dew of the Holy Lights, that were made ready for all mankind at the be­ ginning of time in the well of Israel . The active power of Abraham’s bl essing to all the peoples of the world will become manifest, and it will serve as the basis of our renewed creativity in Eretz Israel . The destruction of our day is a preparation for a new and unique re­ nascence of the deepest dimensions. The Light of God’s grace is shining.

( This essay is in its own right one of the grea t p i eces of modern writing about the Jew, and it is a source of regret tha t i t was outside the scope of this v ol u m e . ) Peguy said of Lazare : “ Bec au s e a man wears sp e c ta c les, because he wears eyeglasses athwart a fold on his nose, in front of two bi g eyes, modern man believes h i m to be modern, modern man is i nca p ab l e of seeing, does not see, does not know how to recognize the ancien t­ ness of the prophetic look . . . He was a fellow who had the very h ab its of freedom. He had freedom i n his skin, in his marrow and in his blood; in his spine. And not a t all an intellectual and conceptual freedom, a bookish freedom , a ready-made freedom, a library freedom either. A tra de- m arked freedom. But a freedom, rather, of t h e well­ spring, a w h ol ly o rg a nic and l ivi n g freedom. Never have I s e e n a man believe to s uch a deg re e, to s uch a degree be certain, t o such a deg ree be aware tha t a man’s conscience is something absolu te, invincible, eternal, s om et h ing free, tha t victorious and everlas tingly t r i um pha n t s tands firm against al l the greatness of th e earth.” Lazare was born in Nimes, southern France, i n 1 86 5 in an assimi­ la ted fami l y of S ephardi c extraction.

I t is obvious that th e S l) ­ ca l le d upper class among western Jews, a n d especially among FKnch Jews, is in an advan ced s t a t e of decay. I t is n o longer Jewish, it is not Christian, and it is incapable of s u b s t i t u t i n g a p h i losophy, even less a free m o ra l ity, for the creed it no l on ger owns. Whereas t he Chris t i a n bourgeoisie holds itsel f upright than ks to the co rs e t of its dogmas, traditions, mo rality, and of .its conventional principles, the Jewish bourgeoisie, deprived of its age-old stays, poisons the Jewish nation w i th its rottenness, and it will poison the other nations if i t does not make u p its mind-and this is s om ethin g we cannot too strongly u rge upon it-to adhere to the Christianity of the ru ling c l asses, so that J uda ism may get rid of it. Now, while this category of Jews thought only of the acquis i t i o n of fortunes, dignities, honors, decorations, and high positions, while the lesser Jewish bourgeoisie developed intellectually, the ancient ghetto was already being rebuilt. According to economic a nd political cir­ cumstances, anti-Semitism was being born, but these circumsta n ces were only, it should be clearly noted, t he immediate ca u s es , sui ted to reawaken ancient prejudices. Anti-Semitism aimed at the res t o rat i o n of t he old legislation against Israel; but this self-assumed purpose was an ideal purpose. What real and practical purpose has it achieved? I t has not succeeded and will probably not succeed in France, Austria, and Germany, in again erecting separate dwelling qu arte rs, or in en­ closing the Jews in a special area, as is the case in Russia; but thanks to anti-Semitism a moral ghetto has very n ea rly been re-established. No longer are Jews cloistered in the West; no longer are chains stretched at the ends of the streets on which they dwell, but around them has been created a hostile atmosphere, an atmosphere of dis­ trust, of latent hatreds, of unavowed-and thus all the more powerful -prejudices, a ghetto more terrible than one whence you m igh t escape by rebellion or exile. Even when this animosity is d i ssem b l ed , the i n tell igent Jew is aware of it; henceforward he feels a res i sta n c e , he has the impression o f a wall erected between him and those in wh os e midst he li ves. What, at the present moment, can you show the Jew of eas tern Europe, who so keenly desired to attain the positio n of his wes t e rn brothers? You can show him the Jew pariah.

Will yo u perm i t me to sum up for you the position which we Zionists take in the fo llowi n g state­ ments : We believe that the J ews are s om e th in g more than a purely religi o u s body; th a t they are not only a race, but also a nation; t h o ugh a natio n without as yet two important requis i tes-a common ho m e and a com­ mon lan guage. We believe that if an end is to be made to Jew i sh misery and to the excep ti on a l position which the J ews occupy-which is th e prima ry cause o f J ewish mi sery- the J ewish na tion must be placed o nce a ga i n in a h ome of its own . We believe that such a n a tion al regenerati on is the fulfillment of th e hope which has been p resent to the Jew throughout his lon g and pa inful history. We believe that only by means of such a na tional regen era tion can the rel igious regeneration of the Jews take place, and they be put i n a position to do that work in the rel igi o us world which P rovi denc e has a p poin ted for them. We believe that such a ho m e can only n a tura lly, and wi th o u t vio­ lence to their whole pas t, be found in the land of their fathers-in Pal es ti n e. We b eli eve that such a return must have the guarantee of the grea t powers of the world, in order to secure for the Jews a stabl e future. And we hold that this does not mean that all Jews m us t return to Palestine. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the Zionist program. We ta ke h ope, for has not that Jewish Zio n is t said, “We belong to a race that can do everything but fail.””

It is this kind of assimila tion, with the terrible cons eq uen ces in­ dica ted, that I drea d most; even more than pogroms. To this fonn of assi milation, Zionism in the sense d e fi n ed will prove, and i s already proving, a most wholesome check. Whatever faults may be found with its real or self-appointed leaders, Zionism as a whole forms an opposing force against the conception o f the destiny of Israel and the interpretation of its mission the lea d i ng thought of which is ap­ parently the well-known epi gra m, ”Whosoever shall seek to ga in his li fe shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.“ Zionism declares boldly to the world that J u da ism means to preserve its life by not losing its li fe. It shall be a true and h ealt hy life, wi t h a policy of its own, a religion who ll y its own, i n vigora t ed by sacred memories and sacred en vi ronm e n ts , and proving a tower of stre n gt h and of unity not only for the remnant gathered within the borders of the Holy Land, but also for those who shall, by choice or necessity, prefer wha t now constitutes the Galut. The tem1 Galut is here loosely used, expressing, as I have often beard it, th e despair and helplessness fel t in the presence of a great tragedy. And the tragedy is not imaginary. It is real, and it exists everywh e re . It is a trag edy to see a grea t ancient people, d i s t i n guis hed for its l oyal ty to its religion, and its devotion to its sacred law, losing thousands every day by the mere process of attrition. It is a t rage dy to see sa c re d institutions as ancient as th e mountains, to maintain which I sra el for t ho us a n ds of years shrank from no sa c rifi ce, d est royed before our very ey es and exchanged for corresponding institutions borrowed from hostile rel i g i ons . It is a trage dy to s ee the language held s a cred by all th e world, in which Holy Writ was composed, and which served as the d ep osi tory of Israel’s grea t est and best tho ugh t, doomed to oblivion and forced out gradually from the synagogue.

* “Every American Jew who aids in advancing the Jewish settlem en t in Palestine, though he feels that neither he nor his descendants wi l l ever live there, will likewise be a be tter man and a better Ame ri ca n for doing so. Note what Seton-Watson1 says : “America is full of nationalities which, while accepting wi t h en ­ thusiasm their new American ci tizenship, nevertheless look to so m e centre in the old world as the source and inspiration of their nati on al culture and traditions. The most typical instance is the feeling of the American Jew for Palestine, which may well become a focus for his declasse kinsmen in other parts of the world.” There is no inconsistency between loyalty to America and loya lt y to J ewry. The Jewish spirit, the product of our religion and experi­ ences, is essentially modem and essentially American. Not since the destruction of the Temple have the Jews in spirit and in ideals been so fully in harmony with the noblest aspirations of the country in which they lived . America’s fundamental law seeks to make real the brotherhood of man. That brotherhood became the Jewish fu ndamen t al law more than twenty-fi ve hundred years ago. America’s insistent demand in the twentieth century is for social justice. That also has been th e Jews‘ striving for ages. Their affliction, as well as their religion, has prepared the Jews for effective democracy. Persecution broadened their sympa thies . It trained them in patient endurance, in self-control, and in sacrifice. It made them think as well as suffer. I t deepened the passion for righteousness . Indeed, loyalty to America demands rather that each America n Jew become a Zionist. For only through the ennobling effect of i t s strivings can we develop the best that is in us and give to t h i s country the full benefit of our great inheritance. The Jewish spirit. so long preserved, the character developed by so many centuries of sacrifice, should be preserved and developed further, so that in America as elsewhere the sons of the race may in the future live lives and do deeds worthv of their ancestors . But we have als � an immediate and more pressing duty in the performance of which Zionism alone seems capable of affordi ng eff ec­ tive aid. We must protect America and ourselves from demora l iz3 - tion, which has to some extent already set in among America n Jew s. The cause of this demoralization is clear.

It is the laborious task of inculcating self-respect, a task which can be accomplished only by restoring the ties of the Jew to the noble past of his race, and by making him realize the possibilities of a no less glorious future. The sole bulwark against demoralization is to develop in each new genera­ tion of Jews in America the sense of noblesse oblige. That spirit can be developed in those who regard their people as destined to live and to live with a bright future. That spirit can best be developed by actively participating in some way in furthering the ideals of the Jewish renaissance; and this can be done effectively only through furthering the Zionist movement. In the Jewish colonies of Palestine there are no Jewish criminals; because everyone, old and young alike, is led to feel the glory of his people and his obligation to carry forward its ideals. The new Palestinian Jewry produces instead of criminals, scientists like Aaron Aaronson,2 the discoverer of wild wheat; pedagogues like David Yellin;8 craftsmen like Boris Schatz,4 the founder of the Bezalel; intrepid Shomrim, 11 the Jewish guards of peace, who watch in the night against marauders and doers of violent deeds. And the Zionist movement has brought like inspiration to the Jews in the Diaspora, as Steed8 has shown in this striking passage from The Hapsburg Monarchy: “To minds like these Zionism came with the force of an evangel. To be a Jew and to be proud of it; to glory in the power and pertinacity of the race, its traditions, its triumphs, its sufferings, its resistence to persecution; to look the world frankly in the face and to enjoy the luxury of moral and intellectual honesty; to feel pride in belonging to the people that gave Christendom its divinities, that taught half the world monotheism, whose ideas have permeated civilization as never the ideas of a race before it, whose genius fashioned the whole mechanism of modern commerce, and whose artists, actors, singers and writers have filled a larger place in the cultured universe than those of any other people. This, or something like this, was the train of thought fired in youthful Jewish minds by the Zionist spark. Its effect upon the Jewish students of Austrian universities was imme­ diate and striking. Until then they had been despised and often ill­ treated. They had wormed their way into appointments and into the free professions by dint of pliancy, mock humility, mental acuteness, an d clandestine protection. If struck or spat upon by ’Aryan‘ students, they rarely ventured to return the blow or the insult. But Zionism”

Today the purple cap of the Zionist is as respec ted as tha t of a ny academical association. “This moral influence of Zionism is not confined t o uni vers i ty students. It is quite as noticeable among the mass of the y o u n g e r Jews outside, who also find in it a reason to raise their heads, a n d , taking their stand upon the past, to gaze s tra ightfo rwa rdly into th e fu tu re. ” Since the Jewish p rob lem is si ngle and universal, the Jews of every country should strive for its solution.

Our fellow Americans are infused with a high and generous spirit, which insures approval of our struggle to ennoble, liberate, and other­ wise improve the condition of an important part of the human race; and their innate manliness makes them sympathize pa rticu l a rl y with our efforts at sel f-h elp .

Solomon Schechter invited him in 1 909 to be principal of the Teachers‘ Institute of the Seminary; in the next year Kaplan was appointed professor of homiletics in its Rabbinical School, and since then he has held a variety of other posts at that institution. Always active as a rabbi and community leader, Kaplan ”invented‘’ the idea of the synagogue-center in 1 9 1 6, when he organized the Jewish Cen ter in Manhattan. After a few years he broke with this group, wh ich would not follow him as his religious views became more l iberal, to found t h e Society for the Adva ncement of Judaism ( in 1 92 2 ) . This synagogue was crea ted to reflect his concept of what an institution of Jewish religion should be, and Kaplan has remained its guiding spirit as leader, and now, as leader emeritus, to the present. \Vhether as teacher or, a fter his late thirties, as an increasingly prolific writer and lecturer, Kaplan’s t rue career has been in the service of his philosophy of Judaism. His approach, which he named Reconstructionism, was expounded in fudaism as a Civili%ation, a book which caused a furor when i t appeared in 1 9 34 · These con­ troversies grew more heated in the next ten years, as several Re­ constructionist prayer books appeared, with important deletions from the traditional texts, and as he published a succession of other volumes in exposition of his views. The passages by which he is represented here come from his most recent major book, The Future of the American few. Kaplan’s premises are essentially the same as Kallen’s, though he is far more involved in religion. For Kallen it is enough to define J ucla· is m as one of many parallel national civilizations; Kaplan regards reli gion as so characteristic of Jewish experience that he insists on a h yp henated adjective-religio-national-as the correct way to describe this particular civilization.

Does the p rop osa l contribute to the so l ut io n of the Jewish problem, a p roblem p regnant wit h danger to ourselves and to the world? Does the pro p o sa l stand the two tests? It is the duty of the C o n gress to give a clear answer. The answer is a wa i t ed in Warsaw, in Bucharest, and in B erlin. And those who have the l u ck to be under the protection of a l iberal reg im e must bethink themselves before the y offer a reply. The point here is not to calculate in percen tages wh at part of Eretz I s ra e l is being offered to us. We can all cou n t . B u t our task is to forecas t the a n swer which l i fe will giv e to the two tes ts . I s it possible to clo this, or is it not? I beli eve it is. I believe a n a nswer ca n be given. Nay, more, I bel i ev e it must be given . The choice lies b e t we e n a J ew i s h m inority in t h e whole of Palestine or a com pact J ewish S ta t e i n a part. I n ow address mysel f to t h ose with whom I h a v e not alwa y s been p ol it i cal ly at one. I s p ea k not as a Mizrahi, but as a d eepl y religious ma n , a l th ough not a stri ct observer of the reli g i ou s ritual. I make a sharp di s t in c t i on between the present realities and the messianic hope, whic h is part of our very selves, a h ope embedded in our traditions a n d sanctified by the mart y rd o m of thousands of y ea rs , a h o p e which the nation cannot fo rge t w i t ho u t c ea s i n g to be a na tion . A time will come when t h e re shall be nei ther enemies nor fro n t i e rs , when w ar shall be n o more, and men will be s ec u re in the di gn i ty of ma n . Then Eretz Israel will be ours.

* “made for a number of years to paper over this quarrel by pretending that it did not exist. It was far more comfortable to imagine that the Israeli maximalists were really hard bargainers who would, eventual­ ly, reach a compromise much more favorable to Israel’s interests than could be achieved by those who were more moderate in advance. This opinion was supported by the feeling that the religious faction, the believers in the imminence of the Messiah, were a picturesque minority. They did defy the government with such outrageous acts as settling a handful of zealots in the very center of hostile Hebron, but the mainstream of the ultra-nationalists were much more secular people who would be open to compromise. In the 1 970s the theory that almost everyone in Israel was ulti­ mately willing to compromise was never tested because the Palestin­ ians and their supporters in the Arab world kept rejecting any sugges­ tion of compromise. The mood in Israel in the 1 970s, even among the moderates, was largely dominated by the bitterness engendered by Israel’s near defeat in the Yom Kippur war of October, 1 973. The prime minister of those days, Golda Meir, who was the head of the moderate Labor Party, kept saying to those of her own supporters who urged negotiation toward compromise: “With whom shall we negotiate? With ourselves? ” But the notion that the leaders of Israel would make a deal at an opportune moment was dramatically strengthened in 1 979 when the first prime minister of Israel from the hardline camp, Menachem Begin, signed a peace agreement with Anwar Sadat, returning all of the Sinai Peninsula to Egyptian control. This agreement was read by American Jews and others as proof that Begin and his followers might go farther still in the cause of peace. Contrary voices in Israel, where there were many, and in the United States, where there were very few, read the peace agreement as an end and not a beginning: Menachem Begin could return the Sinai to Arab sovereignty because it was not part of the sacred and untouchable entity, biblical Israel. He and his followers would draw the line at any further surrender of territory. It took the decade of the 1 980s for the American Jewish commun­ ity, or at least large parts of it, to recognize that this second view was correct. Jewish settlements in the West Bank (the biblical Judea and Samaria} kept increasing. Some were established in the name of secu­ rity at border points such as the Jordan River, but other settlements were scattered, especially when Likud was in power, all over the West Bank with the avowed purpose of making it impossible to detach this”
